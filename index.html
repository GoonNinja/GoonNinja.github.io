              Hi, my name is Adam. I enjoy golfing, coding, playing video
              games. I'm currently studying Computer Programming and Analysis
              at Georgian College in Barrie. My previous career was in the 
              construction sector but had to change careers and come back to 
              school due to a brain tumour. Luckily it's been removed and eventually
             I will be back to my old self, all that behind im excited to start this 
              new chapter in my life and see where the IT sector will take me. 
            </p>
